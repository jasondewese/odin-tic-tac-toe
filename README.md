# odin-tic-tac-toe
A simple game as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice with objects in JavaScript using factory functions and the module pattern. 


# What I learned
- How to use factory functions to create objects in javascript
- How to use the module design pattern to encapsulate and namespace my functions
- Using closures and returning object literals to create public and private functions and properties
- How to assign a function with a parameter value as an event listener to multiple DOM elements using a loop and an anonymous function
- The browser runs on a single thread so DOM updates within functions do not render on the screen until after the function returns and the trhead is available again. So if multiple JavaScript function calls take place and a DOM update needs to be seen, you can use a setTimeout to give the thread back to the browser for just a moment so it can update the screen before moving on in the script.
